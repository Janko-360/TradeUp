# TradeUp

This is a C++ command line application. The functionality aims to simulate the cryptocurrency stock market. One observes the market, buys and sells the crypto for a profit. 

The goal of this programming exercise was to get my feet wet with C++. I coded along Dr Matthew King and later expanded his functionality by adding my own. 
To distinguish: Dr. King M. provided the main menu with the bulk of its functionality. The advisor bot was my own work entirely and some additional statistics. 

The PDF report specifies my modifications in extensive detail.
