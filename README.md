# TradeUp

This is a C++ command line application. The functionality aims to simulate the cryptocurrency stock market. One observes the market, buys and sells the crypto for a profit. 

The goal of this programming exercise was to get my feet wet in the C++ world. I coded along the professor, later expanded his functionality and added my own. 
To distinguish: The Professor, Dr. Matthew Yee King, provided the main menu with the bulk of its functionality. The advisor bot was my own work entirely. 

The PDF report specifies my modifications in extensive detail.
